/**
 * #### Summary
 * Gets the gas price for the current network as gwei
 * - uses EthGasStation for mainnet
 * - uses ethers.estimateGas other networks
 * - can use currentNetworkInfo {@link TNetworkInfo.gasPrice} gasPrice as fallback
 *
 * #### Notes
 * - if the gas price is unknown it returns undefined
 * - updates triggered by {@link BlockNumberContext}
 * - uses the current provider {@link ethersProvider} from {@link useEthersContext}
